# Platform
## Overview
This is an attempt to learn OpenGL and (maybe) make a simple platformer.

## Compilation
```bash
make        # compiles the program
make test   # compiles and runs the program immediately as a test
make help   # get helpful information regarding configuration options
```

## Troubleshooting
`platform` requires `OpenGL >= 3.3`. Discover the version installed on your computer with `glxinfo`.
